### This repository contains audio files used in the experiments conducted as a part of my work (Dyatlov, 2023)

### Contents:
1. **ground_truth** - files recorded by an English speaker (special thanks to Oksana Tsegoeva)
2. **jane_210000** - files made by a fine-tuned M-AILABS ("Jane Eyre") model
3. **jane_210000_22050hz** - files made by a model fine-tuned on the M-AILABS ("Jane Eyre") dataset with resampled files (sample rate - 22050 Hz)
4. **jane_210000_24000hz** - files made by a model fine-tuned on the M-AILABS ("Jane Eyre") dataset with resampled files (sample rate - 24000 Hz)
5. **jane_210000_new** - files made by a model fine-tuned on the M-AILABS ("Jane Eyre") dataset with changed hyperparameters
